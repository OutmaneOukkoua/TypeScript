This TypeScript script serves as a comprehensive guide covering fundamental concepts, types, and features of the language. It includes examples of variable declarations, tuples, functions, interfaces, enums, object-oriented programming, generics, and TypeScript utilities. The script also defines custom types and demonstrates their usage. Towards the end, an asynchronous function using async/await and Promises is showcased. This repository provides a valuable resource for TypeScript learners and developers seeking a detailed understanding of the language.
